# simple-pwd-generator
A universal App for Mac/iPad/iPhone that generates passwords. Not trusting randomness from the generator, some things that seem un-streamlined are used to add factors of randomness. 

## Password types
Password types are random-character or English word/multi-word/phrase. You can use separators in either type of password.
